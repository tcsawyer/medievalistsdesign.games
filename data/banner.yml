  Medievalists Design Games is a collaborative event created to generate
  prototype tabletop games for educational use and in hobbyist spaces.
  Relationships established at this event will facilitate productive
  conversation between medieval studies, critical game studies, and game design
  praxis. Medievalists Design Games will invite a cohort of medievalists to the
  Weston Game Lab at the University of Chicago for three days as an anchor event
  for the Year of Games programming (AY 2025-26), a campus-wide celebration of
  the aesthetic expressions and experimentations in agency that games afford.
  The Year of Games will bring together campus partners including the Regenstein
  Library, the SMART museum, the MADD Center, and the Logan Center for the Arts.
