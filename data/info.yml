  <b>Medievalists Design Games</b> brings together expert board game designers, leading thinkers in critical game studies, and a cohort of medievalists for a collaborative and interdisciplinary event. Participants will explore the affordances of analog design for representing current research in medieval studies in conversation and play. We will craft prototype games for further development and remixing. These prototype designs, along with design notes and reflections, will form an archive with enduring <b>ludic value</b> for hobbyist gamers and <b>pedagogical value</b> for educators and students. <br><br><br>

  Questions of historical representation and agential fashioning in games and play are current in the academy and in the public sphere. Medievalists Design Games places medieval studies at the forefront of the developing field of board game studies. Participants will be well positioned to return to their own communities and institutions with a firm grasp on critical discourses surrounding analog play <b>in the classroom and beyond</b>.<br><br><br>
